## AWS: SDK Reliability & Regional Resilience

### Stabilizing a High-Risk Public SDK Release with Proactive Dependency Alignment

**Context**  
A public-facing SDK used by external customers had a complex publish pipeline. While reviewing the upcoming release, I noticed the latest published model had an **unusually large diff** compared to the previous version, creating risk for regressions, difficult reviews, and loss of confidence in the release process.

**Goal**  
Ensure the next SDK release could proceed smoothly while reducing friction and preventing recurring large-diff issues in future publications.

**Approach**  
- Analyzed the diff and identified that several **required packages and dependencies were missing or misaligned** relative to the mainline commit.
- Traced the issue to gaps in how dependencies were selected during the publish workflow rather than to functional code changes.
- Collaborated with the SDK release manager to define a short-term workaround:
  - Created a formal exception request for the problematic components.
  - Compiled a **complete, authoritative list of required packages** and identified the **closest commit ID to mainline** that could be safely released.
- Documented the end-to-end workaround and decision points so future releases wouldn’t require rediscovery or ad-hoc debugging.

**Outcome**  
- Unblocked the next SDK release, applying a **large set of changes in a single, controlled publication**.
- Reduced manual intervention and review overhead for subsequent releases.
- Prevented the large-diff issue from repeatedly blocking the SDK pipeline.
- Built trust with the team by proactively improving a critical backend release process early in my tenure.

### Improving Multi-Region Deployment Safety for Amazon Connect

**Context**  
Amazon Connect was being expanded to support **Tokyo and Osaka regions**, including automated traffic redirection during regional outages. The deployment involved paired-region replication and complex infrastructure orchestration.

**Goal**  
Ensure reliable, deterministic multi-region deployments while reducing operational risk and unnecessary duplication.

**Approach**  
- Reviewed the existing deployment workflow and identified:
  - A **suboptimal deployment order** that increased the risk of partial or inconsistent state.
  - A **duplicated deployment region** that added unnecessary complexity and operational overhead.
- Reordered the deployment sequence to ensure foundational resources were created before dependent stacks.
- Removed the duplicated region from the deployment pipeline, simplifying the overall topology.
- Supported event-driven replication workflows that:
  - Replicated resources to the paired region on stack changes.
  - Automatically propagated DNS updates for failover.
- Worked within an infrastructure stack using **CDK, CloudFormation, Route 53, EventBridge, Step Functions, and Aurora PostgreSQL**.

**Outcome**  
- Improved reliability of multi-region deployments across **Tokyo and Osaka**.
- Reduced deployment complexity by eliminating redundant regional deployments.
- Lowered the risk of misconfigured failover during outages.
- Contributed to a more maintainable and predictable regional expansion model for Amazon Connect.
