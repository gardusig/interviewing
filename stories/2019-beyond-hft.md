## Beyond: High-Frequency Trading

### Accelerating Onboarding in a Large C++ Codebase

**Context**  
A junior engineer joined the team with strong fundamentals but no prior exposure to either the financial trading domain or our large, performance-critical C++ codebase (hundreds of thousands of lines). The learning curve was steep, and inefficient onboarding risked slowing both individual productivity and team delivery.

**Goal**  
Enable the engineer to become independently productive as quickly as possible, without creating long-term dependencies or requiring ongoing hand-holding.

**Approach**  
- Started with structured pair programming on small, low-risk bug fixes to introduce:
  - Overall codebase architecture  
  - Build and deployment system  
  - Coding and review standards  
- Gradually increased task complexity, transitioning to a small but end-to-end feature with a clearly defined scope.
- Aligned on design upfront to reduce rework and reinforce system-level thinking.
- Provided detailed code reviews focused on *why* changes were required, not just *what* to change.
- Used short, regular check-ins to unblock progress early while preserving ownership.

**Outcome**  
- Within **~3 months**, the engineer was contributing independently to **core trading components**.
- Reduced ramp-up time compared to previous hires in the same codebase.
- Lowered review and rework overhead for the team after the initial onboarding phase.
- Established a repeatable onboarding approach reused for subsequent hires.

### Building a Safe Testing Environment Without Exchange Access

**Context**  
I joined a small company building a high-frequency trading system with **no prior finance or market microstructure background**. There was no access to a real exchange or sandbox—only a static PDF describing exchange rules—making safe development and validation a major risk.

**Goal**  
Rapidly build domain understanding and enable safe development of an order-sending system without risking capital or deploying untested behavior to a live exchange.

**Approach**  
- Invested early in learning core market concepts, including:
  - Order books and price levels  
  - Order types and time-in-force semantics  
  - Matching and execution rules  
- Worked closely with the CTO to validate interpretations and resolve ambiguities in the exchange specification.
- Identified the primary risk as **lack of a realistic test environment**, rather than strategy logic itself.
- Designed and implemented a simplified exchange simulator directly from the PDF specification:
  - In-memory order book  
  - Matching and execution logic  
  - Basic latency modeling and state transitions  
- Used the simulator as a local test harness to validate:
  - Order lifecycle behavior  
  - Edge cases (partial fills, cancels, rejects)  
  - Failure scenarios  
  before building the production order sender.

**Outcome**  
- Enabled safe, iterative development without access to a real exchange or risking capital.
- Converted an ambiguous, static PDF into executable behavior, uncovering multiple edge cases before production.
- Reduced integration risk by validating order flow early.
- Built sufficient domain expertise to actively contribute to system design discussions despite starting with **zero finance background**.

### Operating a Live Trading Bot Under Exchange Constraints

**Context**  
As the system matured beyond experimentation, we needed a production-grade trading bot capable of operating during live market hours and interacting directly with the stock exchange. This required **low latency, high reliability, and strict correctness** under real market conditions.

**Goal**  
Design and operate a trading bot capable of safely sending and managing **hundreds of orders per second** throughout the trading day while minimizing operational and financial risk.

**Approach**  
- Implemented the core trading application in **C++**, deployed on **EC2**, communicating directly with the exchange via **WebSocket / FIX-based protocols**.
- Built extensive pre-deployment testing covering:
  - Full order lifecycle handling  
  - Exchange error and reject scenarios  
  - Network instability, reconnects, and session recovery  
- Introduced layered safety mechanisms:
  - Rate limiting to prevent exchange throttling  
  - Pre-send order validation  
  - Kill-switches to immediately halt trading under abnormal conditions  
- Gradually expanded functionality as confidence increased, adding support for new order types and strategy parameters without disrupting live trading.

**Outcome**  
- Successfully operated a live trading bot throughout the trading day, reliably handling **hundreds of orders per second**.
- Maintained system stability under real market conditions with **zero critical production incidents**.
- Avoided trading halts or capital-impacting failures.
- Established a stable production foundation that allowed the team to focus on strategy iteration rather than infrastructure firefighting.

### Implementing FIX Protocol Integration and Custom Message Handling

**Context**  
As part of direct exchange integration, I worked with the FIX protocol for the first time. Documentation was dense, tooling was limited, and the system also required real-time communication between the trading engine and a front-end interface via WebSockets.

**Goal**  
Correctly implement FIX-based communication while extending standard messages to support internal strategy parameters and real-time observability.

**Approach**  
- Studied FIX protocol fundamentals in depth, including:
  - Message framing, sequencing, and session management  
  - Tag-based encoding and decoding  
  - Differences between session-level and application-level messages  
- Implemented FIX message parsing and serialization in C++, supporting:
  - Custom tags beyond the standard FIX specification  
  - Non-standard field separators required by the exchange  
- Designed a translation layer between FIX messages and internal domain models to isolate protocol complexity from strategy logic.
- Built WebSocket-based communication to the front end, enabling:
  - Real-time order and execution updates  
  - Injection of additional parameters for monitoring and experimentation  
- Validated correctness using recorded exchange traffic and simulated scenarios.

**Outcome**  
- Successfully integrated with the exchange using FIX, including support for custom extensions.
- Enabled richer observability and strategy control without polluting core trading logic.
- Reduced operational risk by isolating protocol-specific complexity.
- Gained deep, hands-on experience with low-level financial protocols used in high-frequency trading systems.
