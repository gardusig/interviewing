# Interviewing

This repository is a personal knowledge base used to prepare for technical and behavioral interviews.

It contains real engineering stories, distilled from past roles, and structured to highlight decision-making, ownership, and impact.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Improve clarity under interview pressure
- Reduce cognitive load when answering behavioral questions
- Encourage reflection on technical and career decisions
- Keep interview preparation structured and reusable over time

## Repository Overview

- resume/  
  Source files for the resume, kept close to stories to ensure alignment between written experience and spoken narratives.

- scripts/  
  Automation utilities used to keep documentation consistent and up to date.

- stories/  
  Company- or domain-specific interview stories, written in a consistent format.

## How to Use This Repo

### Before an interview
- Skim [stories](./stories.md) to refresh key experiences.
- Select a small set of stories that cover different dimensions:
  - Technical complexity
  - Learning something unfamiliar
  - Operating under constraints
  - Cross-team collaboration

### During preparation
- Use stories as anchors, not scripts.
- Adapt details based on the question being asked rather than reciting memorized answers.

### After interviews
- Refine stories while feedback and reflections are fresh.
- Clarify weak points or add missing context revealed by interview questions.

## Public Visibility

This repository is public by design.

Its goal is to reflect thoughtful preparation, clarity of thinking, and professional maturity rather than expose internal details.
